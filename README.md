Project collaboration between groups 509 and 510.


- Clone this repository to a folder of your choosing on your PC.
- Always start your day by pulling.
- When you begin a feature, create your own branch. DO NOT work in the Master branch.
- Remember to comment your code and your commits meaningfully, so we have an overview of the progress.
- Using "SourceTree" for handling this repository is highly recommended.


- *REMEMBER to close down your work programs (like Visual Studio or Unreal) before committing or pushing.


- The .gitignore makes sure that derived files and config files are exluded from the git,
so only the code and the Unreal scenes (and objects within) will be added (preventing fuck-ups hopefully).
